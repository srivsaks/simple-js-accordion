            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that makes
            up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a text
            that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup
            language is a series of markings that tells web servers the style
            and structure of a document. HTML is very simple to learn and use.

            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for
            describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout,
            and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users. CSS
            is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of
            HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. CSS is
            popularly called the design language of the web.

            PHP is a server-side and general-purpose scripting language that is
            especially suited for web development. PHP originally stood for
            Personal Home Page. However, now, it stands for Hypertext
            Preprocessor. Itâ€™s a recursive acronym because the first word itself
            is also an acronym.
